                <h3>About Us</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Efficient transport by sea is an important mode of transportation, particularly for a country like
                    India with an outlet to the sea. Indian Merchant Navy comprises of Passenger Ships, Cargo Liners,
                    Tankers, Ore-Carriers and other types of specialised ships. These Ships are operated by public and
                    private sector shipping companies and are manned by trained Marine Engineers, Navigators and Crew.
                </p>
                <p>Ocean-going merchant vessels are to be manned by competent seafarers who need to be specially
                    trained. Various International Conventions have adopted resolutions to the effect that seafarers
                    manning the merchant vessels must be fully trained for the challenges that this job at sea requires.
                    In order to meet this challenge, the B.P. Marine Academy (BPMA), Navi Mumbai, has been established.
                </p>
                <p>B. P. Marine Academy was formed on the 5th of December 1997 with the objective of imparting marine
                    related training to seafarers and thereby achieves an overall improvement of the quality of
                    seafarers. </p>
                <p>
                    The stricter imposition of various regulations by marine organizations like IMO, Flag State
                    administration etc., requires that seafarers are well trained to achieve their goals. Its purpose is
                    to set up this training center with an aim to enhance the knowledge, skills and attitude of
                    seafarers. </p>
                <p>
                    In the fast changing world of shipping, the spirit of mutual learning between the trainees and
                    trainer is encouraged and this keeps all parties abreast of the latest management and technical
                    innovation. </p>
                <p>
                    The center has state of the art teaching aids and practical demonstration equipment, which meets the
                    latest requirement of training. The center has an up to date fully air conditioned Library with
                    Internet facility. </p>
                <p>
                    Quality System Certification ISO 9001:2008 is in place from ABS Industrial Verification Inc.
